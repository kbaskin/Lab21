	<h2>About Me!</h2>
	<p>I was born and raised in Troy, MI where I attended Troy High School and then went to college at Northwood Universtiy. I graduated from Northwood with a BBA and a duel major or Business Management as well as a degree in Fashion Marketing and Management. Since college, I have wokred in the events and customer service industries. First by doing sales and events for a hotel in Troy and then for the past 5.5 years doing fundraising and event for The Salvation Army Eastern Michigan Division.</p>
	<p>I realized I was not happy in my field and did not with to pursue events or business for the rest of my career. I had been following Grand Circus for a couple years and always thought the coding and tech industry was fascinating. After taking a few of the beginners classes, I decided to dive head in and switch careers and kicking it off by taking one of the full time Java boot camps.</p>
	<p>I am almost half way done and who knows where my next step in this joureny will be.</p>
