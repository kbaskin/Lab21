	<h2>MY PORTFOLIO</h2>
	<H4>WHERE I CAN SHOW OFF ALL MY SWEET SKILLS!</H4>

	<p>While I have been at Grand Circus for the past 4 weeks (can't believe I am almost halfway done! eek!) I have been working on a slew of projects. Anywere from indivdual work, to our midterm, which we completed with selected teams. I had a blast working on our midterm, as we built a library and I love to read! See below the link to my GitHub to check out my projects and be sure to look at my Midterm. <br> <br>Keep checking back to see my updated and better work (the more I learn, the better it will be) as my GitHub is regually updated and by that, I mean daily. </p>
